## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for the ROS 2 Fundamentals Module based on the specification and plan. The tasks are organized by user story (P1-P3) with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities. Tasks include creating ROS 2 nodes (publisher/subscriber), services, URDF files, and educational content. Each task follows the required format with checkboxes, IDs, and story labels where appropriate.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown for ROS 2 fundamentals module implementation
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with organized task breakdown
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks properly organized by user story with dependencies and parallel execution opportunities

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
