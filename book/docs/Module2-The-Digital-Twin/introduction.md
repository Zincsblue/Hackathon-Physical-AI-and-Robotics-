# Digital Twin - Python Agents & ROS 2 Controller Integration

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain the concept of a digital twin and its relevance to humanoid robotics
- Create Python agents that connect to ROS 2 controllers using rclpy
- Understand how URDF describes robot structure and joints for digital twin applications
- Implement proper communication patterns between agents and controllers for humanoid robots
- Apply best practices for agent-controller integration in digital twin systems

## Chapter Overview
This chapter introduces you to digital twin technology in the context of humanoid robotics, focusing on how to bridge the gap between physical robots and their virtual counterparts. You'll learn how to create Python agents that communicate with ROS 2 controllers, enabling real-time synchronization between physical and virtual systems.

We'll explore this through practical examples that demonstrate the core principles of digital twin technology, with special attention to humanoid robotics applications.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of basic ROS 2 concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Basic Python programming knowledge
